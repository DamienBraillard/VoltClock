# VoltClock

This type of clocks can be seen at various places from the internet, nothing brand new. Only issue
is that it's quite hard to find a detailled instructions on how to do one.
Here is my implementation of it along with all the steps required to create one for you.

The clock uses an Arduino and a RTC module to keep up with the time.

Display is done through three 5V analog voltmeters. One for the hours, one for the minutes, and one for the seconds.

# Setup
TBD
